📊 Amazon Sales Data Analysis
🔍 Overview
Sales management plays a crucial role in navigating competitive markets and optimizing distribution strategies to increase profitability and reduce costs. This project explores Amazon sales data to uncover insights that can aid in informed decision-making for sales performance, inventory planning, and trend forecasting.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Power BI / Tableau (for interactive dashboards)

Excel (preprocessing and exploratory insights)

SQL (optional, for querying and aggregating data)

⚙️ ETL Pipeline (Extract – Transform – Load)
Extract

Collected synthetic/public Amazon-like sales datasets from Kaggle and GitHub.

Transform

Cleaned, formatted, and enriched data (e.g., parsed dates, calculated profits).

Handled null values, removed duplicates, standardized categories.

Load

Imported into analysis tools (Power BI/Tableau) for visualization.

Also used Pandas in Python for trend discovery and KPI calculation.

📈 Key Analyses Performed

🔍 Insights & Relationships
Analyzed correlations between:

Discounts vs. Sales Volume

Profit Margins vs. Product Category

Shipping Time vs. Customer Satisfaction (if available)

💡 Findings & Recommendations
Strong seasonal impact observed, with Q4 (Oct–Dec) driving ~35% of annual sales — likely due to holiday shopping.

Technology and Accessories categories showed highest profitability per unit.

Cities with faster delivery timelines also showed higher repeat purchase rates.

Suggested optimizing logistics in high-return regions and bundling low-performing products with popular ones to increase basket value.
